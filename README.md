object oriented programming is a programming paradigm or style of programming (is not programming language or tool);
oop is supported by : c#,java,Ruby,python & JavaScript ...
oop has 4 concepts :    1- Encapsulation   2- Abstraction   3- Inheritence    4-polymorphism 

1)Encapsulation:
befor oop ,we had produced of programming that invided the program into a set of functions so we have data stored in bunch of variables and functions that operate on the data.
there is so much interdepency between all these functions,it becomes problematic, oop came to solve this problem.
in oop we combine a group of related variables and functions in a unit , we call that unit an object;
variables=>properties     ...     functions=>methods
